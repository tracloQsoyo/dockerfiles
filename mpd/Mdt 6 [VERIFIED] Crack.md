## MDT 6 Components
  
MDT 6 consists of several components that work together to automate the deployment process. These components are[^2^]:

- **Deployment shares:** A shared folder that contains all the files and settings required for deployment, such as operating system images, applications, drivers, packages, task sequences, rules, and scripts.
- **Rules:** A set of configuration settings that control how MDT performs various tasks during deployment, such as capturing user data, installing applications, or joining a domain.
- **Boot images:** A set of files that allow a computer to boot into Windows PE (Preinstallation Environment) and connect to a deployment share.
- **Operating systems:** A collection of source files or captured images of Windows operating systems that can be deployed to target computers.
- **Applications:** A collection of software programs that can be installed on target computers during or after deployment.
- **Driver repository:** A collection of device drivers that can be injected into the operating system image or installed on target computers during or after deployment.
- **Packages:** A collection of updates, hotfixes, or language packs that can be applied to the operating system image or installed on target computers during or after deployment.
- **Task sequences:** A series of steps that define how MDT performs the deployment process, such as partitioning disks, applying operating system images, installing applications, or running scripts.
- **Task sequence templates:** A set of predefined task sequences that cover common deployment scenarios, such as standard client task sequence or sysprep and capture task sequence.
- **Selection profiles:** A way of filtering the contents of a deployment share based on criteria such as folder name or architecture. Selection profiles can be used to create custom boot images or media.
