If you want to get the most out of your Football Manager 2013 experience, you might also want to check out some tips and tricks that can help you improve your performance and enjoy the game more. Here are some of them:

- Use the hints and tips feature. The game provides you with various hints and tips that can guide you through different aspects of the game, such as tactics, transfers, scouting, training and more. You can access them by clicking on the light bulb icon on the top right corner of the screen. You can also customize which hints and tips you want to see by selecting 'FM' -> 'Preferences' from the menubar, then the 'Hints and Tips' sub-tab on the 'Preferences' screen. [^1^]
- Choose your transfers carefully and make the best out of your youth. You don't have to buy Ronaldo because you find it funny. If domination is to be achieved then you have to use youth and make transfers only on players you find that are really important and provide depth. Depth is the most important factor in achieving success. FM 13's fatigue system ensures that players are more tired than they would be in FM 12. For example, in FM 12, after a game the player could achieve 100% fitness in maybe 3 days; but in FM 13, the player will not achieve that in maybe even an entire week. [^2^]
- How to find the best players and regens. Regens are new players that are generated by the game every year to replace retired players and keep the game world realistic. They can have great potential and become world-class players if you scout them and sign them early. To find them, you can use various filters and search methods, such as looking for players with high potential ability, scouting specific regions or countries, using your scouts' recommendations or using third-party tools like FMEL (Football Manager Editor Live).

These are just some of the tips that can help you succeed at Football Manager 2013. There are many more that you can discover by playing the game yourself or by visiting online forums and websites dedicated to Football Manager fans. Have fun and good luck!
